************Here's the algorithm to find the index of a target element in a rotated sorted array with O(log n) runtime complexity:******************

1.Initialize two pointers, left and right, pointing to the start and end of the array, respectively.
2.Perform a binary search by iterating until left is less than or equal to right.
3.Calculate the middle index as mid = (left + right) / 2.
4.Check if the element at the middle index is equal to the target:
	If it is, return the middle index.
5.Determine if the left half of the array is sorted or the right half is sorted by comparing the middle element with the left and right elements:
	(i).If nums[left] <= nums[mid], the left half is sorted.
	(ii).If nums[mid] <= nums[right], the right half is sorted.
6.If the left half is sorted, check if the target falls within the range of the left half:
	(i).If nums[left] <= target < nums[mid], update right = mid - 1 to search in the left half.
	(ii).Otherwise, update left = mid + 1 to search in the right half.
7.If the right half is sorted, check if the target falls within the range of the right half:
	(i).If nums[mid] < target <= nums[right], update left = mid + 1 to search in the right half.
	(ii).Otherwise, update right = mid - 1 to search in the left half.
8.If the target is not found in the current iteration, continue with the next iteration until left is no longer less than or equal to right.
9.If the target is not found in the array, return -1.

***************Here is the algorith in pseudocode:*********************

function search(nums, target):
    n = length(nums)
    if n == 0:
        return -1
    
    # find pivot index using binary search
    left, right = 0, n-1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if nums[mid] > nums[right]:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid
    
    # binary search for target
    pivot = left
    left, right = 0, n-1
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        realmid = (mid + pivot) % n
        if nums[realmid] == target:
            return realmid
        elif nums[realmid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    
    return -1
